                            Sunday, August 21st, 2022 finishing up college makes me feel pretty good 
                            about myself. I'm super excited that I have come this far and how well 
                            I'm doing in each one of my classes. It's very funny. Never thought 
                            I’d end up going. Growing up everyone pushed me to go. Teachers, students,
                            and grandparents, but I was always interested in going, but not knowing 
                            for what. The problem with high school is everyone pushes you to go and
                            take something for college. What people don’t sometimes understand is why 
                            would I want to go to something I do not desire. why would I go just to be 
                            in debt with a degree that is either useless or not enjoyable to me? I'm 
                            one of the lucky ones. For years even in high school, I have no idea what 
                            my future was capable of. Six almost seven years and here I am. Someone 
                            who did the bare minimum. Someone who didn’t care. Someone that is now on 
                            the honours list and working very hard to support himself and afford a 
                            small apartment on his own with a full-time job and being able to own his 
                            own car and drive to where he needs. To be honest I kind of find it not 
                            that hard. I didn’t realize you just have to try, and things will work 
                            out the way they're supposed to.

                            Wednesday, August 10th, 2022, staying true to yourself is important. This 
                            night could have changed it all for me but recently I came to the realization 
                            that I haven’t been. Going out this night was a good start to the night being 
                            out with friends, the usual. I was in a very good mood back in my hometown 
                            seeing old faces and catching up. I don’t ever enjoy going downtown because 
                            I've seen some unwelcoming stuff throughout the years of working at a nightclub 
                            and to be honest, I'm not a fan of it, I just attend so I can see people and 
                            potentially meet a cool girl. For the first time in a long time, I felt wanted 
                            I felt needed but when I decided to expand my night it turned out not to go as 
                            I wished it went. Let's just say I made a bad decision that could have changed 
                            my life and I'm glad that didn’t happen. But for once when I felt like I was 
                            being true to myself, it backfired. I'm grateful for being in the position I 
                            am in life but sometimes the grass isn’t always greener on the other side of 
                            the fence. You never know what’s going on behind closed doors with anyone no 
                            matter who they are, what they do, or how much money they make. It's important 
                            to stay true to yourself but always remember it can get the best of you.

                            January 1st, 2022, new me new year, right? Of course!  New Year was amazing for 
                            me. My friends and I wanted to do something different this year and go up to my 
                            friend's lake house in Aspley, Ontario. It was such an amazing time for the first 
                            time ever I popped my first champagne bottle. That was a blast. Also, my first-time 
                            having brie cheese. That was so delicious can't forget that night. I told myself I 
                            was going to read 12 books this 2022 year. Now for me, that was a lot but completely 
                            possible. A book a month but also, I was starting college on the 10th. Had to keep 
                            that in mind because this means I was going to be a busy person. This year was going 
                            to be the year I start going to the gym and finally losing belly fat. Guess we’ll see 
                            a new year new me.
